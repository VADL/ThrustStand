Calibration run performed on 8-3-16. This is to recalibrate the system after intalling the large n2 bottle, regulator, and hose going to the test stand. The metal hose appears to possibly affect the calibration of the system.

ADDITIONALLY:

The gain of the amplifier was changed from 110 to 1100, saturating at ~6N. This calibration is to characterize the system with this new gain and analyze the possible effects of the amplified noise.
